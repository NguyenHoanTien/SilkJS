When running on a micro instance, mysqld can run out of memory and exit.

This will cause the SilkJS WWW server to respawn child processes who 
continually exit because they can't connect to MySQL.

The following settings in my.cnf may help:

key_buffer              = 8M 
max_connections         = 30 // Limit connections
query_cache_size        = 8M // try 4m if not enough 
query_cache_limit       = 512K
thread_stack            = 128K
